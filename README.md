# Archipelago-Manual-WorldofWarcraft-MoPLeveling
This AP World requires the use of the Mists of Pandaria Expansion of World of Warcraft, as all the zones and content are defined as they were during that expansion.
I'll let you figure out how to play on that expansion on your own ;)

## Goal
* Level your character all the way up to maximum level depending on the expansion you have chosen (example: Mists of Pandaria = Level 90)
## How to play
* Select which of the two faction you want to play in your YAML. This will give you the correct zones to level in
* Each Level Up will send 1 item from the pool
* You can only go past a certain level once you find the appropriate "Maximum Level" items
* You can only level up in the zones you have unlocked
* There are many options you can turn on in the YAML, including Talent Rows, "Hardcore", Dungeons, etc.
